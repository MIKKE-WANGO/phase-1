Aviation Accident Data Analysis (1962 - 2023) 📊

Welcome to the **Aviation Accident Data Analysis** repository. This project is focused on conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of aviation accidents between 1962 and 2023, with the goal of extracting insights to help identify the lowest-risk aircraft for potential purchase and operation by the company's new aviation division.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The goal of EDA is to provide a deep understanding of the dataset and reveal hidden patterns, correlations, and potential risk factors. Below is a breakdown of the analysis steps:

### 1. **Data Overview and Cleaning**

Before diving into analysis, we inspect the structure of the dataset:
- Display the first few rows and columns.
- Check for missing or inconsistent data.
- Summarize data types and ensure they are in the correct format.

```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_dataset.csv')
data.head()
###2. **Summary Statistics
Generate summary statistics for both numerical and categorical variables:

##Numerical variables: Descriptive stats such as mean, median, standard deviation, and outliers.
##Categorical variables: Frequencies of various categories like aircraft makes and accident causes.
python
Copy code
data.describe()
###3. **Missing Values Analysis
Detect and visualize missing values in the dataset using a heatmap to ensure no key data is lost during analysis.

python
Copy code
import seaborn as sns
sns.heatmap(data.isnull(), cbar=False, cmap='viridis')
###4. **Data Distribution and Trends
We visualize the distribution of key variables, such as accident year, to understand overall trends:

Accident frequency over time: Spot trends in accident occurrences.
Aircraft makes: Discover which types of aircraft are most often involved in incidents.
python
Copy code
sns.histplot(data['Accident Year'], bins=30, kde=True)
plt.title('Accidents by Year')
plt.show()
###5. **Correlation Analysis
We explore relationships between numerical features using correlation matrices. For example, we might find out how accident severity relates to aircraft age or flight conditions.

python
Copy code
sns.heatmap(data.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
6. Geographical Data (if available)
For spatial analysis, we explore the geographic locations of aviation accidents using geopandas or other mapping tools.

##📈 Key Visualizations
Some key visualizations included in the analysis:

Accident Trend Over Time: A line plot to visualize the number of accidents each year.
Aircraft Make Distribution: A bar plot showing the frequency of different aircraft models involved in accidents.
Correlation Heatmap: A heatmap visualizing the relationships between numerical variables such as aircraft age, flight hours, and accident severity.
These visualizations are included in the notebooks/ directory, and can be dynamically generated within the Jupyter notebooks.

##🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
This project leverages the following Python libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization based on Matplotlib.
